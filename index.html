                <p><em>Senior lecturer</em> <strong><a href="www.politeknik.edu.my">Politeknik Mukah </a></strong></p>
                <p>I am an established freelance developer in Mukah, Sarawak. My main points of focus are in Web and
                    Mobile Apps,
                    with a specific focus in React and Android. Speed and efficiency are what I focus on when creating a
                    project. It
                    needs to be simple, work properly, and get done in timely manor that doesn't break the bank. I have
                    experience
                    with other frameworks as well including Vue, PHP and Flutter (experimental Android / iOS language).
                    Most of my
                    previous projects have used Amazon Web Services, Firebase or MongoDB. I have a special interest in
                    creating
                    databases and REST api's in either MySQL or NoSQL. Feel free to contact with any questions to.</p>
